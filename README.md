Download tracks from youtube and soundcloud and set IDv3 tags straight from the command line

#### If you want set covers with the CLI, you have to create a folder named `covers` inside the root folder

#### If you want to download youtube tracks, you need to install [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and add it to your PATH environnement variable

HOW TO:

Build :
> npm run build

Dowload a track from Soundcloud/Youtube :
> npm run start -- [trackUrl]

-- much more in package.json > scripts ! --
